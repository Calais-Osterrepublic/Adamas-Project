# The Adamas Project
The Adamas Project is a plugin for Endless Sky, a free, open-source 2D space game.

While I enjoy the overpriced and overpowered Adamas of the base plugin, I decided to make my own variant of the original, with small tweaks to put the Adamas tech on par with the adjacent Wanderer civ.

Props to the original creator and the current manager, Kestral1110. Great people in their own right.

This plugin has been abandoned by the original developer (toilethinges); there is now an updated version on Bereskatuket's fork:
